title: "Getting Started with Rtichoke"
---

This tutorial provides a basic introduction to the `rtichoke` library. We'll walk through the process of preparing data, creating a decision curve, and visualizing the results.

## 1. Import Libraries

First, let's import the necessary libraries. We'll need `numpy` for data manipulation and `rtichoke` for the core functionality.

```python
import numpy as np
import rtichoke as rk
```

## 2. Prepare Your Data

`rtichoke` expects data in a specific format. You'll need two main components:

*   **Probabilities (`probs`)**: A dictionary where keys are model names and values are NumPy arrays of predicted probabilities.
*   **Real Outcomes (`reals`)**: A NumPy array containing the true binary outcomes (0 or 1).

Let's create some sample data for two different models:

```python
# Sample data from the dcurves_example.py script
probs_dict = {
    "Marker": np.array([
        0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
        0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9
    ]),
    "Marker2": np.array([
        0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
        0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9
    ])
}
reals = np.array([
    1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
])
```

## 3. Create a Decision Curve

Now that we have our data, we can create a decision curve. This is a simple one-liner with `rtichoke`:

```python
fig = rk.create_decision_curve(
    probs=probs_dict,
    reals=reals,
)
```

## 4. Show the Plot

Finally, let's display the plot. Since `rtichoke` uses Plotly under the hood, you can show the figure just like any other Plotly object.

```python
# To display the plot in an interactive environment (like a Jupyter notebook)
fig.show()
```

And that's it! You've created your first decision curve with `rtichoke`. From here, you can explore the other curve types and options that the library has to offer.
